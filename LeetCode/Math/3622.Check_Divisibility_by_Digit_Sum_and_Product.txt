//QS: 
You are given a positive integer n. Determine whether n is divisible by the sum of the following two values:

//The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).

//The digit product of n (the product of its digits).

//Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false.



//Code:
class Solution {
    public boolean checkDivisibility(int n) {
        int sum = 0 , prod = 1 , nCpy = n;
        while(n>0){
            sum += (n%10);
            prod *= (n%10);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        return ((nCpy % (sum + prod)) == 0);
    }
}

Time Complexity : O(logn)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
